# Starfinder Charactor Creator
This is a C# Application I created for fun.  Its not finished but I put somwhere around ~250 hrs of work into it.  
I learned allot about Inheritance and OOP programming creating this application but grew frustrated with Windows forms clunky UI
I've abandoned this one but took alot of the work and put it into a Library called SFLib.
I'm currently using it on a new version of this application that uses WPF, MVVM Framworks and Databinding.  Good times!
